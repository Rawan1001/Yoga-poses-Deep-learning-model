    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Yoga Pose Image is a collection of the images for yoga exercises,The pictures mostly consists of one person doing a pose of yoga. In this project we aim to classify and predict the name of the pose. Our goal is to build deep learning model on this data.\n",
    "## Problem statement:\n",
    "In this project we have a collection of unordered pictures of yoga poses, and our goal is to classify and predict the name of the pose.\n",
    "## Data Description:\n",
    "The datasets we selected are:\n",
    "- from Keggel [**Yoga Pose Image classification dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutisaxena/yoga-pose-image-classification-dataset),the whole dataset.\n",
    "- from the website [**New Dataset for Yoga Pose Classification**](https://laurencemoroney.com/2021/08/23/yogapose-dataset.html),200 picture for eash poses.\n",
    "- from kaggel [**Yoga Pose Image classification dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutisaxena/yoga-pose-image-classification-dataset),around 100 picture for each pose.\n",
    "Which contains 5 Classes: the Tree Pose, Warrior1 Pose, Downward Dog Pose, godess pose, and the mountain pose. \n",
    "we have about 3478 pictures.\n",
